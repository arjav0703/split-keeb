## 10/5/2025 - Started Working  

Installed KiCad and initialized a project and repository. I started off with installing the schematics from Seed Studio OPL library and then I installed the mito-simplified footprint library. After that, I installed the marblastlib library for switches.![42dc57cef5cc22d410a6c8f6dd275413c4132c0b09281b813f672183312ad285.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTgwLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--fc8e85594e90bef1e9d239232376df016218899f/42dc57cef5cc22d410a6c8f6dd275413c4132c0b09281b813f672183312ad285.png)
